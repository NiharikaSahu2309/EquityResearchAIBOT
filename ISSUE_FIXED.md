# âœ… Issue Fixed Successfully!

## Problem Resolved
The compilation error with the `Smart` icon from Material-UI has been fixed.

### What was the issue?
- The `Smart` icon doesn't exist in the `@mui/icons-material` library
- This was causing a compilation error: `'Smart' is not defined`

### How it was fixed:
1. **Removed the non-existent `Smart` icon** from the import statement
2. **Replaced it with `Send` icon** for the Standard Chat option
3. **Cleaned up unused imports** to remove warnings

### Current Status:
- âœ… **Frontend**: React app running on http://localhost:3000 (compiled successfully)
- âœ… **Backend**: FastAPI server running on http://localhost:8000 (working properly)
- âœ… **Communication**: Frontend successfully making API calls to backend
- âœ… **All Features**: File upload, stock analysis, chat, and RAG working

### Final Result:
Your Equity Research Assistant Bot is now **fully operational** with the React + FastAPI architecture!

ðŸŽ‰ **The application is ready to use!**
